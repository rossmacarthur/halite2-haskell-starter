# Haskell starter

Haskell starter bot for Halite-II.

Based on the Python 3 starter.

Disclaimer: this is the first time I (@rossmacarthur) have ever coded Haskell, feel free to submit a PR to change any poorly principled code.

### Usage

Copy `halite.exe` / `halite` binary into this directory and execute `run_game.bat` / `run_game.sh`. By default this runs the starter bot against itself.
